## Dataset

The Ford Gobike Dataset contains records from rides  gotten from a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The 
dataset contains 183412 and 16 columns coonsisting of duration, start time and end time column. start station and end station Id, start
station and end station longitude and latitude, member gender, user type amongst other column.

I introduced 6 new columns which are start day, start month, start hour, end day, end hour and end month column which was gotten start time 
and end time column.

After cleaning the dataset, I dropped rows with mising information which made our dataset to become 174952 rides and 22 columns.

I changed the new columns, member gender, user type and bike share for all trip from string to categorical datatype
I changed station Id from float to string
I changed start time and end time from string to datetime



## Summary of Findings
After my exploration on the dataset I made the following findings

- There were more male users than female users
- Most users started their ride on the 8th, 9th which indicate morning rush to work and the ended their rides on 17th and 18th hour which
  indicate rushing hours home from work
- Subcribers took the most ride than Customers
- More Subscribers shared their bike and no customer was allowed to shared their ride
- They were more rides on Tuesday and Thursdays which are weekdays
- The Gender category 'Other' prefer going on ride during weekends especially on Sunday and they usually have ride duration of over 1800 
  per seconds during weekends
- The gender category 'Other' gender has long duration when the start their ride at the 2nd or 3rd hour and they also had longer ride 
  duration than male and female user
- Male always start rides earlier than female and other gender
- There is a positive relationship between start day, end day as regard duration. As start day increases, end day tends to decrease and
  vice versa.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I focused more on the distribution of Rides End Day, distribution of Rides Per Gender, Relationship Between Rides 
Month and User Type

Afterwards I checked the relationship of duration across Gender and User Type, Hour and Gender, Day and Gender. My key insights in this 
exploration is to find out the duration each gender takes on rides, which particular day and hour each gender like going on rides.

I made use of seaborn countplot to show the distribution of the categorical variables and pointplot to show the relationship of duration
across different categorical variable.
